  # KS Finearts - Art Collective
  
  KS Fine Arts - collective that mixes different forms of visual arts - Painting, Mural Painting, Design & Photography.
  We are creating together since August 2019, based in Wroclaw, Poland. 
  Founders: Szymon Koniarek & Konrad Sokołowski.
  Every artist is showing his own point of view, while describing surrounding reality through the art of visuals.
  Collective has open & free form. Different forms of media & art will be presented on our site - without any frames & borders. 
  We believe that art today, as the form of communication, should be modern & based on diversity & emotions.  
  
  ## Konrad Sokołowski
  
  Konrad Sokołowski is a Polish artist, painter and tattooer born in Wolsztyn 1989. 
  A graduate of the University of Arts in Poznań in the field of design and product design. First steps in drawing and painting under the guidance of prof. Arkadiusz Marcinkowski and prof. Andrzej Łubowski. He deals with broadly understood visual painting, using various painting techniques as well as formats on which works are created. The carriers of his works are not only canvas, but also walls and surfaces of buildings, where easel painting often seems to penetrate directly into urban space, combines oil painting and graffiti art, using a variety of painting techniques. Since 2016, an active tattoo artist, creates his own cartoon and newschool designs, often referring to known cartoon characters, while reworking and modifying them in a fun, humorous and specific way. Such relationships also seem to apply to painted wall surfaces. The subject of works on canvas is everyday life, people, genre scenes, as well as many years of tradition and places with which the artist was associated from an early age.
